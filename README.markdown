# SDET Assessment

**General Instructions**

1. Plan to spend about 2 hours completing this exercise.
2. Please document any assumptions made.
3. This is a real world exercise. You may use libraries and frameworks as you see fit. Solutions found by Google Search or on Stack Overflow are acceptable â€“ as long as you understand them.
4. You do not need to connect to a real, online dictionary. The idea is to create a mock object to simulate this.
5. Please send your solution as a zip file or send a link to your private GitHub repository, so that we can evaluate your work.

**The Problem**

Using Java, find all of the English words in a given String. For example, if you are given the word WORKING, you can easily find WORK and KING, but ROW, RING and KNOW are also in there. You have access to a utility class called Dictionary, which has one method, isEnglishWord(String word). Dictionary.isEnglishWord(String word) connects to a (mocked) online dictionary and returns Boolean true if the String passed to it is an English word, return false otherwise.

Instructions
1. Use Maven to create a project to answer this problem.
2. You will need to create the Dictionary class.
3. You will need to mock Dictionary.isEnglishWord(String word) for your solution and tests.
4. The output of your primary method should be a collection of Strings without duplicates.
5. Create tests that exercise your class and methods.
6. Please complete the instructions to the best of your ability and understanding and come prepared to discuss the design decisions you chose.

**Assumptions**

1. The input string itself does not need to be an english word.


**v1.1: Notes**
1. A bug was fixed where an empty string was being added to the permutation hashset.
2. Implemented new connection to AWS API Gateway. 
    1. Using an AWS Lambda function, the API responds randomly with 30% true and 70% false. 
    2. Code for Lambda function can be found in index.txt.
4. Added more robust unit tests for DictionaryTest.
    1. After more thought, I realized I should have written the dictionary 
       tests as though the API call was working. 
    2. This time, I implemented the test to cover actual scenarios. 
        1. Since the results in the actual program are random, the unit tests will fail randomly.
5. Added Maven dependency for gson.
6. Added Maven dependency for httpclient.


**v1.2: Notes**
1. Updated index.js to check for words in a DynamoDB Dictionary.
    2. The dictionary only has words with 5 characters or less (~16,000).
